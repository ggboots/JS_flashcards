Project Tools

> Realtime Database 
> Firebase cloud Functions
> Firebase Storage

If you want to use, this is how:
upload JSON data to db in cloud
upload image content to firebase storage
add firebase config as .env file

** out of respect to the developer who made these cards, i have not submitted to any cloud or repo which can be publicly accessed 

*Did play around with firestore cloud and mongodb to see how they would differ
using realtime database, as using string data as reference for when i do indeed reference firestore storage
TODO:

1. .env cloud firestore config --using cloud functions
https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/config-env

- script command to change .pdf files to .png (file conversion)
2. Firebase Photos read (how to put images into firebase db) DONE
3. coding card UI
