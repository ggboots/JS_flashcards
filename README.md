If you want to use, this is how:
upload JSON data to db in cloud
upload image content to firebase storage
add firebase config as .env file

** out of respect to the developer who made these cards, i have not submitted to any cloud or repo which can be publicly accessed 

*Did play around with firestore cloud and mongodb to see how they would differ
using realtime database, as using string data as reference for when i do indeed reference firestore storage
TODO:

* not using firebase functions, as paid tier, keeping API_Keys local and not in repo
1. .env cloud firestore config --using cloud functions
https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/config-env

- script command to change .pdf files to .png (file conversion)
2. Firebase Photos read (how to put images into firebase db) DONE
3. coding card UI 
4. JSON data contains raw text, use that for accessibility
